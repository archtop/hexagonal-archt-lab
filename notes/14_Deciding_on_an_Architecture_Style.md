# Deciding on an Architecture Style

- ### When should we actually use the Hexagonal Architecture Style?
- ### When should we rather stick with the conventional layered style?
----

## The Domain is King

### The Hexagonal Arch Style make the Domain Code Free from Diversions 
- #### such as persistence concerns and dependencies to external systems

### Evolving Domain Code Free from external influence 
- #### is the single most important Argument for The Hexagonal Arch Style
- #### This is why this architecture style is such a good match for DDD practices

### In DDD, the Domain Drives the Development
- #### Best reason about the domain without thinking about 
    - persistence concerns and other technical aspects at the same time
- #### Domain-Centric-Architecture-Styles are enablers of DDD

### No Chance of really Doing Domain-Driven Design
- #### without an architecture that puts the domain into the center of things
- #### without inverting the dependencies towards the domain code
- #### the design will always be driven by other factors

### If the Domain Code is NOT the most important thing in your application
- #### you probably don’t need this Hexagonal Arch Style

## Experience is Queen

### We’re Creatures of Habit
- #### Habits automate decisions for us, so we don’t have to spend time on them

> Habits are just as good at helping to make a right decision as they are in 
> making a bad one

### The only way to make an educated decision about an architecture style 
- #### is by having experience in different architecture styles
