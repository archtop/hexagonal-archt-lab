# The Goal of this This Project

- ### Actually implement Hexagonal Clean Architecture
- ### Providing a hands-on-code discussion about creating a web application in the Hexagonal Architecture Style
- ### In order to live up to that goal, the code examples and concepts discussed in this Project provide one interpretation of how to implement a Hexagonal Architecture
- ### I do not claim mine to be the silver bullet for all situations
- ### I certainly hope, however, that you will find some of the concepts in this book helpful enough to include them into your own toolbox
