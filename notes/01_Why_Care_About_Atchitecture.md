# Why Care About Architecture?

## I want my software not only to fulfill 
  - The customer’s explicit requirements
  - The hidden requirement of maintainability
  - My own requirements concerning structure and aesthetics
      - aesthetics: the qualities and ideas in a work of art or literature that relate to beauty and the nature of art

## The requirement are not easy to be fulfilled, because
  - My software projects usually don’t go as planned
    - Managers are drawing deadlines all around the project team 
    - External partners build their APIs differently from what they had promised 
    - Software products we’re depending on are not working as expected
  - The Consequences
    - Our own software architecture was nice in the beginning and everything was clear and beautiful
    - But then the deadlines pressed us into taking shortcuts
      - Now, the shortcuts are all that’s left of  (遺留在) the architecture 
      - It takes longer and longer to deliver new features, however, the deadline is looming, then, add another shortcuts

## A good software architecture can help me take control myself
  - Not let external factors govern the state of my software architecture
  - I can gain the control by creating an architecture that makes the software soft as in 
      - “**Flexible** (靈活性)”
      - “**Extensible** (可擴展性)” 
      - “**Adaptable** (適應性)”
  - Make it easy to react to external factors and take a lot of pressure from my back
